#Usage
The resource comes with server exports so that you can have the taste of spatial audio.
**Export 1:**
exports['ultra-3dsound']:playSound(source,audioSource,audioCoords,audioRotation)
This :arrow_up: export is used to play audio at specified coord and accepts 4 parameters.
-source is the player source on which action needs to be performed on.
-audioSource being the path of the audio file. You can either pass ./audio.mp3 and it will play a local file stored in html folder of project directory or you can pass a RAW URL of mp3, mpeg, opus, ogg, oga, wav, aac, caf, m4a, m4b, mp4, weba, webm, dolby or flac file. Example: If your file is hosted on localhost:8080/file.mp3 you will pass https://localhost:8080/file.mp3
-audioCoords being vector3 coords at which the audio will be played
-audioRotation being vector3 rotation of the audio

**Export 2:**
exports['ultra-3dsound']:stopSound(source)
This :arrow_up: export stops the playing sound
Iâ€™ve added a distance check to limit the audio range in this version. You can modify the range in 3dsound:playSound client event
